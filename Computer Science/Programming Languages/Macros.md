In C programming language, a macro is a tool for code substitution that uses a symbolic name or constant to represent a value, expression or a code snippet.

Macros are handled by the [[preprocessor]] before compilation.

In a general sense, a macro is a rule or pattern that dictates how a input is to be mapped to a replacement output.

A macro in C can be declared using the ```#define``` preprocessor directive.[^1]

[^1]: As per prof. DD, there exist other preprocessor directives that can be used as macros.
