# Weighted Codes
Weighted codes assign specific numeric values (weights) to each digit position (i.e. value of a digit depends on its position). This is the most basic way a number is represented. All number systems are based on this system.
Some examples include [[Code Translation#^723bf7|BCD]], [[Code Translation#^723bf7|2421]] and [[Code Translation#^723bf7|84-2-1]].

# Non Weighted Codes
Non weighted codes do not have any specific numeric weights assigned to the digit positions. The value of the code is not determined by the sum of its weighted bits. These codes rely on translation to be used and are mostly used for convenience.
Some examples include [[Gray Code]] and [[Code Translation#^723bf7|Excess-3]].
