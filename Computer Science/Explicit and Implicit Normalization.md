IEEE 754 standard of floating point representation uses the implicit normalization method.
The example used will be $5.125$ which is $101.001$ in binary.

## Explicit Normalization
The radix point is moved to the left of the most significant 1.
In this case, it will be 0.101001.

## Implicit Normalization
The radix point is moved to the right of the most significant 1.
In this case, it will be 1.01001.

Implicit normalization is used in modern computers because it allows more storage than explicit normalization as the mantissa is 1 bit shorter.
