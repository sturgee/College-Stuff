### Ideas for future projects:



1. **Pomodoro Timer:** a timer for tracking work and breaks

	-> analytics

	-> ai to suggest better habits



2. **Code Snippet Organizer:** a tool that helps developers store, manage, and quickly retrieve reusable pieces of code.

	-> has multi language support

	-> tags and folders

	-> search functionality

	-> editor integration

	-> cloud sync

	-> export, embed or share via link

	-> uses ai for predictive coding


3. **MetaMaster:** a metadata analysis and editing tool for files.

	 -> allows deleting of metadata

     -> supports all file extensions

     -> can deal with a bunch of files and show comparisons/charts for related data

	 -> sort files according to metadata

	 -> can use links to scrape the web for metadata of files
